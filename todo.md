## Ideas

- Currently txtReader initialData is fill at "boot" from Folder and i might want to change that. To do so i'll need to create a need action type just for that.
- better colors for pdf text link
- iframe language?
- cv language?
- countries flag for i18n
- movable software windows (html draggable?)
- custom color picker in settings
- TxtReader usable
- konami code/secret
- top right time
- volume
- better props validation (switch to TS?)
- widget spotify like to give it more life
- Taskbar can be change to top/left/right/bottom

## Bugs

- The real Browser sometimes broke the css, might need to restart when this happens
- Pdf sometimes doesn't open and it's just a gray brackground (the background color of the actual pdf reader)
