When I had the feeling of having understood the differences, of course understanding is a very big word because I only had time to see the basics and did not pursue the subject, I decided to start on a small project. With the only support, the documentation, in order to experiment by coding.<br>Having only seen the basics, I decided to do something very simple with a form and data processing.<br>Playing Dungeons and Dragons 5e at that time and being a fan of theorycrafting, I used to create different builds. I chose to make a damage calculation tool in order to automate a little of the required mathematics necessary to compare my different builds.",

And what could be better, for a web agency, than to create in-house a tailor-made tool? After all, you are never better served than by yourself!<br>We have therefore chosen you to create this in-house solution. The brief is very short, it is up to you to propose what seems to best suit your needs. In the idea, the boss would like it to be super simple for customers, who are not always very familiar with the IT tool. Ideally, no need for an account (the request could come from any person working within the client company), only a fairly short form, but allowing them to best qualify their needs. And once the ticket was published, we would send him a tracking link for his request.<br>Internally, on the other hand, it's not the same ball game. You will have to imagine an interface to centralize all requests and simplify their management by your colleagues at the agency. Tickets will be processed by the different departments and each response will be accompanied by a way to identify who responded.\"<br><br>I was able to use what I had learned at Canal+ to also take on the role of Git Master and set up conventions and rules for github.<br><br>A copy of my project file with which I passed and obtained the professional title Application Designer-Developer is available in the github repository for more information.",
